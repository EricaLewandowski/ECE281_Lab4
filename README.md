#Discussion

My original problems gave me lots of syntax errors. The ROR and IN functions were not working, and I kept getting errors
concerning using signed with unsigned. The fixes that worked are as follows: 
-Using std_logic_vector instead of signed before unsigned
-Using double quotation marks instead of single quotes
-Using equal signs instead of <= or => with the "if OpSel" statements
